% milonga: a free nuclear reactor analysis code

![milonga](doc/milonga.svg){.img-responsive}\ 



[milonga](http://www.seamplex.com/milonga/) is a free core-level neutronic code that solves the steady-state multigroup neutron transport equation using either

 a. the diffusion approximation, or
 b. the discrete ordinates $S_N$ method
 
over unstructured grids (although simple structured grids can also be used) based on either

 i. a finite-volumes, or
 ii. a finite-elements

discretization scheme. It works on top of the [wasora](http://www.seamplex.com/wasora) framework, which provides means to parse and understand a high-level plain-text input file containing algebraic expressions, data for function interpolation, differential equations and output instructions amongst other facilities. Therefore, any mathematical computation which can be done by wasora---i.e. parametric calculations, multidimensional optimization, function interpolation and integration, etc.---can be combined with the facilities that milonga provides to solve the neutron diffusion equation.

Milonga’s main features are:

 * free & open source software (released under the terms of the [GNU GPL version 3](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html))
 * solves the steady-state few-group neutron transport equation over a [Gmsh](http://geuz.org/gmsh/)-generated unstructured grid in one, two or three spatial dimensions
 * may solve either the discrete ordinates or the diffusion formulation of the transport equation
 * may use either a finite-volumes or a finite-elements spatial discretization scheme to obtain a matrix-casted eigenvalue problem
 * solves any combination of multiplicative and non-multiplicative media with and without independent source
 * can solve for either the direct or the adjoint flux (TODO! only direct flux is computed right now)
 * structured grids may be generated for simple problems within milonga without needing an external mesher (discouraged)
 * macroscopic cross sections are given as algebraic expressions of $x$, $y$ and $z$ in a per-material basis
 * algebraic expressions may involve interpolated point-wised user-defined functions of one or more variable, so cross sections may depend on intermediate spatial distributions (e.g. temperatures)
 * algebraic expressions may involve standard functions ($\sin$, $\cos$, $\exp$, $\log$, etc.) and functionals (integrals, derivatives, roots, etc.)
 * computed results (i.e. $k_\text{eff}$, fluxes, power) are given as scalar variables and functions of $x$, $y$ and $z$ which may be further used in algebraic expressions
 * program output is 100% user-defined (in fact the program is silent if no explicit `PRINT`s are given)
 * milonga may be coupled to other calculation codes using files, shared-memory objects or python bindings
 * non-linear effects (e.g. xenon and/or thermalhydraulic feedback) may be solved in an iterative way
 * multidimensional quasi-random sequential parametric or non-linear minimization cases are easily created from single-run input files
 * milonga may be extended by runtime-loadable shared objects and/or fixed entry-point plugins
 * high-quality free & open third-party libraries are used to perform tasks that other people have already worked out: PETSc, SLEPc, GSL, IDA, Readline
 * new formulations and/or spatial discretizations schemes can be (more or less) easily added
 * milonga interfaces well with other UNIX tools (m4, grep, sed, awk, etc.) and plotting & post-processing tools (Gnuplot, Gmsh, LaTeX, ParaView, Pyxplot, etc.)

Actually, milonga can be seen as a glue layer between a mesh generator (i.e [Gmsh](http://geuz.org/gmsh/)) and a large sparse matrix solver (i.e [SLEPc](http://www.grycap.upv.es/slepc/) for eigenvalue problems and [PETSc](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) for linear problems). That is to say, milonga builds the matrices $R$ and $F$ that cast the multigroup neutron transport/diffusion equation as a matrix-based eigenvalue problem:


$$F \phi = k_\text{eff} \cdot  R \phi $$

Should there be independent neutron sources $S$, then the problem is casted as a system of linear equations:

$$(F-R) \phi = S $$


These matrices are expected to be sparse, as they are the result of the discretization of the differential diffusion operator using either finite volumes or finite elements, over a certain spatial grid either generated by a mesher or structured defined within the milonga input file. Said matrices are thus built in [PETSc](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) format, so they can either be passed to a parallel solver (default is [SLEPc](http://www.grycap.upv.es/slepc/), whose algorithms and parameters may be chosen at run-time) or even dumped into files to be opened later. The macroscopic cross-section may depend on the spatial coordinates $x$, $y$ and/or $z$ (depending on the dimension of the problem) not only because different materials may be assigned to the regions of the domain (i.e. physical entities) but also due to continuous dependence of these cross sections with arbitrary parameter distributions within the entity (i.e. temperatures, densities, poison concentration, etc.). These dependencies can be given either as point-wise interpolated functions or algebraic expressions (that may in turn involve point-wise defined data). 

Milonga provides also a second glue layer that links the output of the linear/eigen-solver to the input of a post-processing tool (i.e [Gmsh](http://geuz.org/gmsh/) or [ParaView](http://www.paraview.org/)). The effective multiplication factor $k_\text{eff}$ is stored as a wasora variable, and the fluxes and power distribution as point-wise defined multidimensional functions, which can then be added, subtracted, integrated, differentiated, etc. Parametric and optimization runs may be also performed.

# Quick start

> It is really worth any amount of time and effort to get away from Windows
if you are doing computational science.
>
> <https://lists.mcs.anl.gov/pipermail/petsc-users/2015-July/026388.html>

Open a terminal in a GNU/Linux box (may be a VirtualBox box) and install the following tools:

```
sudo apt-get install m4 make autoconf automake gcc g++ git findutils
```
and the following libraries

```
sudo apt-get install libgsl-dev libsundials-serial-dev libreadline-dev petsc-dev slepc-dev
```

If your distribution does not have a bundled version of [PETSc](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) or [SLEPc](http://www.grycap.upv.es/slepc/), then you might need to compile them yourself. Ask for help in the mailing list at <https://www.seamplex.com/lists.html>.

Clone the milonga repository, bootstrap (might take a while as it has to clone and bootstrap [wasora](https://www.seamplex.com/wasora/) first), configure, compile and check:

```
git clone https://bitbucket.org/seamplex/milonga/
cd milonga
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make check
```

If these instructions are non-sense to you, go directly to the [mailing list](https://www.seamplex.com/lists.html).

# Examples & test suite

After the compilation of the code (that follows the standard `./configure && make` procedure, see `INSTALL` for details), one recommended step is to run the test suite with

```
$ make check
```

It consists of some cases that work both as examples of usage and as a suite of tests that check that milonga implements correctly the functionalities that are expected. Some cases have analytical solution and some not. Some cases used an already-generated unstructured mesh and some others need [Gmsh](http://geuz.org/gmsh/) to be installed. Some cases use [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) to plot results. [ParaView](http://www.paraview.org/) can be used to post-process the last case. For some cases, milonga generates a markdown-formatted text file containing debugging and benchmarking information that can be converted to PDF and/or HTML with [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/). In [Debian](http://www.debian.org)-based distributions, they can all be installed with:

```
# apt-get install gmsh gnuplot paraview pandoc
```


The `make check` command may not show the actual output of the examples but the overall result (i.e. whether the test passed, the test failed or the test was skipped). Expect your screen to be filled up with plots, post-processing views and browsers showing debugging and benchmarking information. Each individual test may be repeated by executing the `test-*.sh` scripts located in the `examples` subdirectory.

User iepale has shared a [set of input files](https://bitbucket.org/iepale/examples) that solve some of the [ANL-7416](http://www.corephysics.com/benchmarks/anl7416_benchmark15.pdf) benchmarks using his [fork of milonga](https://bitbucket.org/iepale/milo-tra) that allows to solve transient solutions. This fork will soon be merged into the [main milonga branch](https://bitbucket.org/seamplex/milonga).
